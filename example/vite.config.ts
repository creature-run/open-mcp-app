 * Vite config for Items MCP.

 * Development mode:
 * - Uses standard Vite dev server with HMR for instant updates
 * - No singlefile inlining (allows proper HMR via WebSocket)
 * 
 * Production mode:
 * - Uses vite-plugin-singlefile to inline all JS/CSS into the HTML file
 * - This is required because MCP App UIs are served as HTML strings in iframes,
 *   which cannot load external assets in production
 * 
 * Tailwind CSS is processed via PostCSS (see postcss.config.js).
 * 
 * Output path matches production structure: dist/{mcpName}/ui/index.html
 * This ensures the server's html path ("items/ui/index.html") resolves correctly
 * in both dev and production modes via the SDK's loadHtml function.
