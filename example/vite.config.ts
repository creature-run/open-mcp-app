 * Development mode:
 * - Uses standard Vite dev server with HMR for instant updates
 * - No singlefile inlining (allows proper HMR via WebSocket)
 * 
 * Production mode:
 * - Uses vite-plugin-singlefile to inline all JS/CSS into the HTML file
 * - This is required because MCP App UIs are served as HTML strings in iframes,
 *   which cannot load external assets in production
 * 
 * Tailwind CSS is processed via PostCSS (see postcss.config.js).
 * 
 * Output path: dist/ui/index.html
 * This path is name-independent so the agent can freely rename the app
 * without needing to update this config. The server's html path ("ui/index.html")
 * resolves correctly via the SDK's loadHtml function.
